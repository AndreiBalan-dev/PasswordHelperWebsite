          What is a secure password?</a><br><br>
        <div class="info-container hidden" id="info-container-1">
          <p>- A strong password is a password <span style="color:red"><b>formatted</b></span>, <span
              style="color:red"><b>preserved</b></span> and <span style="color:red"><b>protected</b></span> accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>- A properly <b>formatted</b> password must contain <span>many characters</span>, <span>with a
              wide variety between these</span>, and essential for important passwords: <span>be difficult to
              memorized</span>, that is to avoid as much as possible the words from the dictionary.</p>

          <p>- To <b>keep</b> a password safe, it is necessary to avoid the installation and execution of
            dangerous programs on your device, but also avoiding entering the password on websites
            which you do not trust.<br><span style="color:red">Caution: Always be careful with websites of the type
              PHISING.</span> </p>
          <p>- <b>Protection</b> of a password is done at common level, because sometimes <span
              style="color:red"><b>security breaches</b></span></p>
          <p>- 2-Factor Authentication is required for a much better protection. If this function is not
            exploited, for each connection attempt you will receive an sms/email and the attacker will need
            a code that only you have access to. As long as you haven't lost your phone or email account, no account
            can be lost for life, even if its password has been changed.</p>
          <p>- The "PasswordHelper" program will help you create a secure password, and will tell you if your current
            password
            is it safe or not.</p>
        </div>
        <button id="info-container-btn-2" class="pointer">Show</button>
        <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it important to have a secure password?</a><br><br>
        <div class="info-container hidden" id="info-container-2">
          <p>- Having a weak password, your account automatically becomes more vulnerable, depending on how weak it is
            password, the account may be compromised.</p>
          <p>- A risk factor is the security loopholes. A security breach happens when someone manages to
            enter a database that includes information about you, such as your name, password, email, etc.</p>
          <p>- Even if the 2-Factor authenticator is important, and seems impossible to defeat, the attackers managed to
            passed over it several times in the past, and to everyone's surprise, the steps towards exploiting it
            functions were not advanced at all.</p>
          <p>- On most websites, your passwords are encrypted, then added to a database. Although
            they are encrypted, some passwords are not difficult to crack if they are weak in terms of formation
            the password. Hackers use the Brute-Force Hash Decryption method that automatically goes through a list of passwords or
            through each individual ASCII character, encrypts it in the respective set of cryptographic hash functions, and
            if your password from an encrypted database (hash) looks exactly the same as the password he obtained,
            then he found out your password and can connect to your account.</p>
        </div>
        <button id="info-container-btn-3" class="pointer">Show</button>
        <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the encryption methods?</a><br><br>
        <div class="info-container hidden" id="info-container-3">
          <p>- Popular encryption methods are SHA256 and MD5.</p>
          <p>- For defense against the verification and concatenation of two hash results between your password and the text
            encrypted by the hacker, through the "Brute Force" method (Brute-Force Hash Decryption), developers use HMAC
            (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) that gives the user and the server used by the user a key
            specific and unique private, different from other keys. The popular communication application "WhatsApp" uses a
            combination of SHA256 and HMAC, this combination is called AES-256 and it cannot be decrypted.</p>

        <button id="info-container-btn-4" class="pointer">Show</button>
        <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is phishing?</a><br><br>
        <div class="info-container hidden" id="info-container-4">
          <p>- Phishingul, vine de la "fishing" in engleza, adica a pescui. Acesta reprezinta o metoda prin care un
            atacator incearca compromiterea parolei a unei victime.</p>
          <p>- Atacatorul creeaza un website similar cu alte pagini web pe care ai un cont creat, si cu un domeniu
            similar acestuia. Websiteul de tip phising este mai apoi redirectionat prin diferite metode catre victime,
            iar cei ce nu au in vedere linkurile pe care dau click vor fi pacaliti sa isi introduca parola pe aceste
            website-uri. Odata ce parola a fost introdusa, atacatorul va avea acces la aceasta.</p>

        <a>&nbsp;&nbsp;How are passwords encrypted in a database?</a><br><br>
        <div class="info-container hidden" id="info-container-5">
          <p>- The process of encrypting passwords is a complex one, which involves guessing a text message after the text
            encrypted impossible. </a>
          <p>- The plain text message goes through many mathematical algorithms and creates an unreadable encrypted text.
          </p>
          <p>- In the picture below you have 2 examples with a database. Above you have an example with a database that does not
            encrypts passwords when adding, which is very dangerous and puts your password at risk. Under this
            we have a database where the password is encrypted in MD5. It can be seen how the plain text "john856" a
            became a long, encrypted and unreadable text.</p>

          <p> Try to encrypt a text in MD5 and SHA-256. Write something in the "Message" box and you will receive one
